Welcome to the Design Patterns RPG, a collection of C# console application projects showcasing various design patterns with a fantasy RPG theme. Each project represents a different category of design patterns, including Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns. The examples are designed to illustrate common design patterns in the context of an RPG game.

The examples provided are for educational purposes only and may not cover all aspects of design pattern implementation in real-world applications. Use them as a learning resource and adapt them based on your specific needs.
